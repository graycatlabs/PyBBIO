The goal of this library is to create a simple programming environment 
similar to the Arduino. At the moment it supports basic digital IO
through digitalRead() and digitalWrite() functions, as well as ADC
support through analogRead(). PWM and UART are on the way, so keep 
checking the Github page for updates.  

I am using the same pin names as are assigned to the BeagleBone's two
female expansion headers in the schematic, which can be found here:
  http://beagleboard.org/hardware/design/

The libraries directory is a place to put PyBBIO specific libraries. 
When PyBBIO is installed, the path to the libraries directory is added
to the installed configuration file. This way these libraries are stored
where they can be easily accessed and added to. The libraries in the 
directory can be imported using standard Python syntax after bbio is 
imported. This is demonstrated in tests/library_test.py using the example
library at libraries/example.py.

The python-mmap module is required and was not installed on my BeagleBone,
despite it usually being part of the standard Python modules. 
It can easily be installed by running at the BeagleBone shell:
  # opkg update; opkg install python-mmap

Installing PyBBIO:
 -With GIT:
   Requirements: 
    -BeagleBone connected to the internet.
    -BeagleBone shell access, either through serial port or ssh.   
   1. On BeagleBone, cd to the location you want to download PyBBIO in, e.g.:
        # cd ~
   2. Clone the git repository:
        # git clone git://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO.git
   3. Run installer:
        # cd PyBBIO/
        # sh install.sh -i
   4. Test PyBBIO:
        # cd examples/
        # python blink.py
      If all is well you should see two of the LEDs next to the Ethernet jack
      blinking back and forth. Press CTRL-C to stop.

 -Without GIT:
   Requirements: 
    -BeagleBone shell access, either through serial port or ssh.   
   1. Download PyBBBIO from:
        https://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO/downloads
   2. Unpack PyBBIO directory and cp onto BeagleBone. The simplest way
      to do this is just to remove the microSD card from the board (not while
      it's on!), pop it in a card reader and mount it on your computer. It
      should mount as two seperate filesystems; open the one called 
      Angstrom-Cloud9- and copy PyBBIO/ to home/root/. Then unmount the card
      and place it back in the BeagleBone.
   Complete steps 3 and 4 above.

Uninstalling PyBBIO:
  1. On BeagleBone, cd into PyBBIO folder, e.g.:
       # cd ~/PyBBIO
  2. Run installer with uninstall flag:
       # sh install.sh -u
  PyBBIO configuration directory and Python module will be removed,
  3. PyBBIO folder can then be deleted, e.g.:
       # cd ..
       # rm -rf PyBBIO
  
Note:
 If you've installed PyBBIO with 'git clone' and then update it with 
 'git pull', you'll have to run 'sh install -i' again for the changes to
 take effect. 


Hardware access is acheived using a memory map of the special file /dev/mem, 
which is a map of the entire physical memory of the AM3358 ARM processor. 
The addresses of all the processor's memory registers, as well as details
on how to properly use them, can be found in the AM335x Technical Reference 
Manual (TI document spruh73c.pdf) which can be found here:
