 EventIO_test.py 
 Alexander Hiam

 An example to demonstrate the use of the EventIO library
 for PyBBIO.

 Example circuit:
  -A switch from 3.3v (P9.3) to GPIO1_7 (P8.4) with a 10k pull-down
   resistor to GND (P9.2)
 
  -A switch from 3.3v to GPIO1_3 (P8.6) with a 10k pull-down resistor.

  -A voltage divider with two equal resistors around 10k between 3.3v
   and GND to make about 1.6v   

  -A potentiometer with the two outer pins connected to the 1.6v output
   of the voltage divider and GND, and the center wiper pin connected to
   AIN0 (P9.39).

 This example program is in the public domain.

  # This sets sw2 to trigger event2 when pressed with a debounce
  # time of 270ms:
  event_loop.add_event(DigitalTrigger(sw2, HIGH, event2, 270))

  # This sets event3 to be called when the value on pot is above
  # 1820: 
  event_loop.add_event(AnalogLevel(pot, 1820, event3))

  # This sets event3 to be called when the value on pot is below
  # 1820: 
  event_loop.add_event(AnalogLevel(pot, 1820, event4, direction=-1))

  # Then start the event loop:
