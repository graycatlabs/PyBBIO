 knock.py - Alexander Hiam - 3/21/2012
 Adapted from the Ardiuno knock.pde example sketch for use
 with PyBBIO - https://github.com/alexanderhiam/PyBBIO

 Uses a Piezo element to detect knocks. If a knock is detected
 above the defined threshold one of the on-board LEDs is toggled
 and 'knock' is written to stdout.

 This is based quite directly on the Knock Sensor example 
 sketch, which can be found in the Arduino IDE examples or 
 here:
